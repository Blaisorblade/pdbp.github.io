## **Introduction**

When writing an introduction it is challenging to find the right balance between providing *too many* details or *too few* details. 
This introduction provides *many* details. 
It is perfectly fine to read this introduction *diagonally*.

Before starting, let's present a bit of history.

### **History**

In 1977, John Backus was an [ACM A.M. Turing Award Winner](https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/backus_0703524.cfm).
The title of his Turing Award winning lecture was 

*Can programming be liberated from the von Neumann style? A functional style and it's algebra of programs.*

This document builds upon the ideas of this influential lecture.
